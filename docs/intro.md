# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome! This book will teach you everything you need to know about building robots that can think, see, and move like humans.

## What You'll Learn

By reading this book, you will:

- Understand how AI works in physical robots
- Learn to control robots using ROS 2
- Create realistic robot simulations
- Build robots that can see, hear, and understand speech
- Complete your own autonomous humanoid robot project

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** is artificial intelligence that lives in robots—not just computers. Think of it as giving a robot both a brain (AI) and a body (physical form).

Regular AI lives in your phone or computer. Physical AI lives in robots that can:
- Walk and move
- See the world around them
- Touch and manipulate objects
- Understand human speech
- Interact with the real world

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are robots that look and move like humans. They're special because:

1. **They fit our world**: Our buildings, tools, and spaces are designed for humans
2. **They're relatable**: People feel more comfortable around human-like robots
3. **They can learn**: They can use data from how humans interact with the world

## How This Book Works

This book is organized into 10 parts:

1. **Part 1**: Understanding Physical AI basics
2. **Part 2**: Learning ROS 2 (the robot's nervous system)
3. **Part 3**: Creating simulations
4. **Part 4**: Using NVIDIA Isaac for advanced AI
5. **Part 5**: Vision-Language-Action systems
6. **Part 6**: Your capstone project
7. **Part 7**: Hardware setup guide
8. **Part 8**: Learning schedule
9. **Part 9**: Projects and assessments
10. **Part 10**: Advanced topics

## What You Need to Start

**Basic Requirements:**
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- A computer (we'll discuss hardware options)
- Willingness to learn and experiment!

**Don't worry if you're new to robotics**—this book explains everything step by step in simple terms.
